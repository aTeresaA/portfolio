# under construction, my first pages publication
# https://ateresaa.github.io/portfolio/
# simple info-site, no forms
# built with safety concerns
# - e.g pictures has been emptied on metadata (exifttool)
# - html tags for no sniff, no embed
# - no imports
# I have used AI for suggestions 
# my process is to tell AI what I am aiming at and ask for suggestions
# and then changed into my own taste
# while working on the changings I slowly learn and re-learn coding
# ----
# - as for the cv, it is also under construction 
# AI made the cv up and I found it interesting that
# out of my input and my own suggestions to AI
# this is what it guessed on my background 
# it is basically ipsum lotem cv
# I am training both pushing to git hub and web development

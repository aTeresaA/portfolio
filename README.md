# under construction, my first pages publication
# https://ateresaa.github.io/portfolio/
# simple info-site, no forms
# built with safety concerns
# - e.g pictures has been emptied on metadata (exiftool)
# - html tags for no sniff, no embed
# - no imports
# work process: tell AI what I am aiming for and ask for suggestions
# make changes to match my goal - learn and relearn by editing the code
# as for the cv, for now, it is basically ipsum ladum as this is what AI guessed from my input
# everything is under construction, both texts and design
